## API Endpoint

There are two api Endpoints > 

Search shipment by carreer 
1. http://127.0.0.1:5000/shipment/carreer_name
2. http://127.0.0.1:5000/order/order_id

Some dummy shipment data saved in `data.txt` for testing purpose


1. Weather Data by API:- I used https://www.visualcrossing.com/ api to get weather information of particular shipment by pincode.
2. Every time we do a call to api, I save weather data to json file with two hours advance time in file with pincode name
3. Next time if we got request for same pincode first I check in dir if pincode file exist and data is still not in 2 hr timeframe to return data from file or if not do the call again to weather api.

4. Testing- There are unit test cases fro both classes in test directory and you can excecute by running command
   `python -m unittest discover -s test -p "*_test.py"`
